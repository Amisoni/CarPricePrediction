# CarPricePridection
This project is aimed to presents a Car Price Prediction System by using the supervised machine learning technique. The research uses multiple methods for cleaning techniques to provide data to Ridge Regression, Lasso, KNN, XGBoost and Random forest. Using multiple cleaning methods and models we will know the perfect methods for cleaning and perfect model for our problem. This paper proposes a system where price is dependent variable which is predicted and this price is derived from factors like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude and 22 other categories. We are making these project using the Pandas, NumPy, Copy, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Math and find the best method for our problem and solving it with using the perfect model.
